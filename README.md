Induction Motor Core Loss Optimization

This repository contains a Python program that calculates key induction motor parameters and optimizes the yoke gap to minimize core losses. The tool is ideal for engineers and researchers focusing on improving motor efficiency and performance.

Features
	•	Calculates motor parameters like power, current, torque, and magnetic flux.
	•	Optimizes yoke gap to minimize core losses and improve efficiency.
	•	Outputs results to a .dat file for easy analysis.

Usage
	1.	Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/induction-motor-optimizer.git
cd induction-motor-optimizer


	2.	Run the Program:

python motor_parameters.py


	3.	Check the Output:
	•	Review the mot-yoke-gap.dat file generated in the script’s directory.

Example Output

Output Power (Watts): 746
Input Power (Watts): 829
Rated Speed (RPM): 1693.62
Running Current (Amps): 5.08
Rotor Diameter (m): 0.0596
Flux Density (T): 1.45
Magnetic Flux (Wb): 0.0029
